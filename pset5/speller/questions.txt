1. What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?

2. According to its man page, what does getrusage do?

Returns usage statistics

3. Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?

16

4. Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?


It's faster


5. Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.


int c = fgetc(fp)
Loop gets the next character in the file ->
Checks it’s an alphabetic character or apostrophe, otherwise word is skipped
If the word fits the criteria, append it to the current word
If there is a space or punctuation -> add \0 and end word



6. Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?

Doesn't read punctuation, only spaces


7. Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?

So that pointer directions cannot be changed, which is not needed in this program
