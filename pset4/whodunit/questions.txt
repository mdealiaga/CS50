1.  stdint.h is a header file in the C stanfard library - to have exact-witdh integer types.
2.  let's you fill exact amount of space required
3.  
BYTE = 8 bits = 1 byte
DWORD = 32 bits = 4 bytes
LONG = signed 32 bits = 4 bytes
WORD = 16 bits = 2 bytes
4. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
bitmap: 42 4D -> BM
5.What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
bfSize - total number of bytes in the file
biSize - total number of bytes in info header (40 in bitmap)
6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
biHeight positive/negative determines image orientation
so the image woul dbe top-down
7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel
bitBitCount
8.  
failure to locate file
