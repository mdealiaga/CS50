0. What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
A word referring to a lunch disease otherwise known as silicosis


1.  According to its man page, what does getrusage do?
Returns measure of resource usage, liek the speed


2.  Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?
16. 2 strucs and 16 long


3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?
So that there are no weird behaviors with copying files that may actually take time and lead to inaccurate calculations



4. Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.

The loop store the word in an array and detects when it ends
If it finds numbers or anything weird, it doesn’t consider it a misspelling
If it reaches the endproperly, it considers it a correct word
Otherwise it considers the word misspelled




5.  Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?
With fscan, how can we know where the word finishes? 


6.  Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?
If we are just checking and loading, we aren't editting the pointers. Thus using a function that has constant pointers is safer.
