# CS50 - Harvard's Introduction To Computer Science

Harvard's CS50 course, which I took on EDx, provided me with an introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.


Topics included abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages included C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML.
